## Challenge -- 💡

  

  

Creating a simple wireframe model representation of a 3D landscape by linking various points (x, y, z) thanks to line segments.

  

  

## Objectives -- ✅

  

  

The wireframe should be able to represent basic geometry aswell as some landscapes :

  

- **700** instructions on average for a stack of **100** integers

  

- **5000** instructions on average for a stack of **500** integers

  
  

## Rules -- 🚨

  

If you are interested in the specifics of the project here is how it is supposed to work :

  

- You have 2 stacks named a and b.

  

- At the beginning :

  

The stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers which cannot be duplicated.

  

The stack b is empty.

  

- The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a. To do so you have the following operations at your disposal :

  

sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.

  

sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.

  

ss : sa and sb at the same time.

  

pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if b is empty.

  

pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if a is empty.

  

ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.

  

rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.

  

rr : ra and rb at the same time.

  

rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.

  

rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.

  

rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.
